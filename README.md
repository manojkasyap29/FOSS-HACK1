## 🎯 What is NutriScan?

Ever looked at the back of a snack packet and wondered what "E621" or "Maltodextrin" actually is? **NutriScan** is an open-source tool that lets you scan the back of any food product using your camera. It automatically extracts the ingredient list, cross-references it with public nutritional datasets, and tells you exactly what you are putting into your body.

No corporate jargon. No hidden sugars. Just simple, readable facts.

## ✨ Features

### Current Features (MVP)
*   📷 **Camera-Based Scanning**: Snap a picture of any ingredient label for immediate extraction.
*   🔍 **Automatic Ingredient Parsing**: Uses robust OCR and NLP to read and understand complex, messy ingredient lists.
*   ⚠️ **Personalization & Allergy Alerts**: Set up a custom profile (e.g., "Vegan", "Nut Allergy", "Keto", "Low Sodium"). If a scanned product violates your dietary needs, the app instantly flags it.
*   🥗 **Healthy Alternatives Recommendation**: If a snack gets a poor health verdict, NutriScan suggests 2-3 healthier open-source/community-curated alternatives in the same category.
*   📊 **Nutritional Verdict**: Gives a clear "Healthy / Moderate / Unhealthy" score based on standardized nutritional benchmarks.

### RoadMap: Future Enhancements
*   🔒 **Privacy-First / Offline Mode**: We plan to move OCR and data matching entirely on-device using local models and an offline SQLite database. Your dietary habits stay on your phone.
*   🌍 **Crowdsourced Database**: Allowing users to manually add missing products or correct OCR errors to build a public good, similar to Open Food Facts but focusing on ingredient flag mapping.

## 🤖 Why Not Just Take a Picture with Gemini or ChatGPT?

While general-purpose AI is powerful, **NutriScan is purpose-built for speed and utility in a grocery store aisle.**

1.  **Instant Structured Data, Not a Conversation**: General LLMs (like Gemini) return paragraphs of text. You have to read through a conversational response to find out if the snack is safe. NutriScan instantly flashes a red/green/yellow score, highlights specific harmful ingredients, and presents data visually. It’s a 1-second interaction, not a reading exercise.
2.  **Zero-Prompting Diet Profile**: With Gemini, you have to type or speak your dietary restrictions every single time: *"Here is an image of ingredients. Tell me if it violates my Keto diet or my peanut allergy."* NutriScan saves your specific dietary profile once. You just point the camera, and it automatically tests the ingredients against your saved restrictions without you ever having to ask.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Architecture Flow)

                                                                            v

```

1. **Scan**: The user captures an image of the ingredient list.
2. **Extract & Clean**: The image is processed through OCR, and the raw text is cleaned using NLP to identify individual ingredients.
3. **Analyze**: The parsed ingredients are checked against our database and the user's personal dietary profile.
4. **Report**: The system calculates a final health score, highlights any allergens or red flags, and offers better alternatives if necessary.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Justification

| Component | Technology | Why we chose it |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OCR / Image Processing** | Tesseract OCR / OpenCV | Open-source, reliable text extraction that can be optimized for mobile or quick backend processing. |
| **Database/Datasets** | Open Food Facts / Kaggle | Comprehensive, community-driven nutritional data to map ingredients to their health impacts. |
| **Backend** | Python / FastAPI | Fast, lightweight, and excellent for serving ML/NLP endpoints. |
| **Frontend** | React / Flutter (TBD) | Cross-platform flexibility so users can scan from any device. |
| **ML / NLP** | spaCy / scikit-learn | Efficiently parsing unstructured text (like "Contains 2% or less of...") into clean data arrays. |

## 🏗️ Proposed Implementation Plan

### 1. High-Level Folder Structure
To keep concerns separated, the project is structured into a React frontend and a Python backend:
```text
FOSS HACK/
├── backend/                   # Python FastAPI Server (ML/OCR Engine)
│   ├── main.py                # Entry point for the API
│   ├── database.py            # PostgreSQL connection setup
│   ├── models.py              # SQLAlchemy Data Models
│   ├── ocr_engine.py          # Functions to process images with Tesseract
│   ├── nlp_parser.py          # Functions to clean text with spaCy
│   └── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
│
├── frontend/                  # React Web App
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.jsx            # Main routing component
│   │   ├── components/        # CameraView, ResultCard, AlertBadge
│   │   └── pages/             # Home, ScanPage, ProfilePage
│   └── package.json
```
### 2. Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
We need three primary tables to make the MVP work:
*   **Users**: Stores the custom profile for Personalization & Allergy alerts (e.g., "Vegan", "Keto").
*   **Ingredients**: Our curated FOSS dictionary of foods with health scores (-1 to 1), descriptions, and flags.
*   **User_Allergies**: Maps a User to specific ingredient flags they want to avoid (e.g., "dairy", "peanut", "artificial").

### 3. API Endpoints Contract (FastAPI)
The frontend app will communicate with the backend via:
*   `POST /api/scan`: Uploads the image and `user_id`. Runs the image through OpenCV -> Tesseract -> spaCy -> Database Match. Returns found ingredients, allergy alerts, and an overall health verdict.
*   `GET /api/user/{user_id}`: Retrieves the user's dietary preferences and specific allergy restrictions.

---

### 4. API Response Format

The backend returns a structured JSON response after scanning an ingredient label.

Example response from `POST /api/scan`:

```json
{
  "ingredients_detected": [
    "Sugar",
    "Palm Oil",
    "Maltodextrin",
    "Monosodium Glutamate"
  ],
  "allergy_alerts": [
    "Contains dairy",
    "Contains artificial additives"
  ],
  "health_score": -0.42,
  "verdict": "Unhealthy",
  "recommended_alternatives": [
    "Roasted Chickpea Snack",
    "Baked Lentil Chips"
  ]
}
```
### 5. Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP error responses when a request fails.

Status Code	Meaning
400	Invalid image or request data
404	User profile not found
500	OCR or ingredient processing failed

The frontend should handle these responses and show appropriate error messages to the user.
---

### 6. Deployment Plan

The planned deployment architecture for NutriScan:

*   **Frontend** → Vercel or Netlify
*   **Backend** → FastAPI server (Docker container)
*   **Database** → PostgreSQL (Supabase / Neon)
*   **OCR Engine** → Tesseract running in backend container

This setup allows the application to scale easily while keeping the OCR and ingredient analysis services centralized.
