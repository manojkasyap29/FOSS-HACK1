## 🚨 Problem Statement

India welcomes millions of international tourists every year, yet navigating the country remains one of the most overwhelming experiences for foreign visitors. Despite holding a valid visa, tourists frequently face critical challenges:

- **Lack of centralized, reliable information** — Travel information is scattered across dozens of unverified websites, outdated blogs, and unofficial apps, making it hard for tourists to plan safely and efficiently.
- **Language and cultural barriers** — India has 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects. Foreign tourists often struggle to communicate, understand local customs, or read signage.
- **Safety concerns** — Tourists, especially solo travellers and women, face risks ranging from scams and overcharging to genuine emergencies, with no single point of contact for help.
- **Visa and regulatory confusion** — Tourists are often unaware of restricted areas, e-visa conditions, photography bans, and region-specific entry rules, leading to inadvertent violations.
- **No government-integrated support** — There is no direct, real-time link between a tourist's visit and government databases, embassies, or local law enforcement, leaving tourists unsupported during crises.

**Our Solution:** *IndiaGuide* bridges this gap by building a government-integrated, open-source web platform that serves as a single, trusted companion for every tourist visiting India — from landing at the airport to safely completing their journey.
